# IETF Roles
The IETF community has many ways to be involved. This page describes formally defined roles within the IETF, what is required to serve in that role, and how to engage in or where/who to contact to find out more about that role. 

IETF participation can be very informal. For many people, it ranges from observing on a mailing list, to commenting on a document at the microphone during a session at an IETF meeting, to providing detailed feedback on an Internet-Draft under consideration by an IETF working group. For more information about how to start participating in the IETF, see the Introduction to the IETF webpage.

## I-D Author
If you write a document in the Internet-Draft (I-D) format then you are an I-D author! Many I-Ds are submitted to the IETF’s I-D repository so it can be easily found and shared for consideration and discussion. While an I-D has no standing in the IETF—even if it is posted to the IETF I-D repository—this is usually the first step to have an idea considered by a working group, or for proposing a topic for a Birds-of-a-Feather conversation, or even for an informal consideration by the broader IETF community. More information about how to author and I-D is available at the I-D Authors’ wiki.

## Document Shepherds
A Document Shepherd helps make sure a Working Group document (I-D) progresses through the IETF process and is ready to be submitted for Internet Engineering Steering Group review. For example, Document Shepherds usually complete the publication request write-up for working group documents. Chairs appoint Document Shepherds, and any active working group participant that has a strong understanding of the document content, is familiar with the document history, and is familiar with the IETF standards process can serve as a Document Shepherd. More information about Document Shepherds is available on the IETF Chairs wiki.

## Document Editors
Document editors help track and implement edits to an I-D to reflect input and discussion from the relevant group considering the document (for example, a Working Group). Editors are appointed by the Chairs of the group, and it is preferred that the Chairs themselves not serve as document editors to ensure a distinction between the process of providing input to the document and the document text itself. More information about Document Editors is available on the IETF Chairs wiki.

## Group Session Notetaker
Every Working Group session has notes taken to ensure important discussion points and decisions are recorded. The approach to taking notes varies by group and individual, and as most group sessions are now recorded, they do not need to be verbatim. Thus, note takers should be familiar with the general topics and individuals involved in a group, but they do not need to be deep experts. Note takers are usually volunteer or several volunteers by group chairs, often identified at the start of a session.

## Session Scribe
Working session scribes help bridge in-person sessions for remote participations, particularly those who aren’t able to follow along with video. They can convey actions taken in the room via group chat, and also convey questions or comments from remote participants to the in-person session. In-depth technical knowledge generally is not required and Working Group chairs are always happy to have volunteers at the beginning of sessions.

## Working Group Secretary
The Secretary’s job is to record WG decisions and help organize group activities at a high level. For example, the Secretary may help identify session note takers, but the role responsibilities do not include taking notes directly. Secretaries are designated by WG Chairs. More information about the WG Secretary role is available in Section 6.2 of RFC 2418. Further information is also available in an expired Internet-Draft which even though it never achieved IETF consensus, may provide useful guidance. Serving as a WG Secretary may provide useful insight and experience for individuals considering serving as a WG Chair.

## Working Group Chair
A Working Group Chair is a designated individual concerned with making forward progress on a group’s charter, through a fair and open process. Chairs are usually extremely familiar and comfortable with IETF processes, though they do not need to be experts in the technical topics covered by the group they chair. Chairs are appointed Area Directors, with usually two (sometimes there are more) chairs for each group. More details about Chair responsibilities are available on the IETF Chairs wiki, and officially documented in Section 6.1 of RFC 2418.

## Working Group Consultant
WG Consultants have specific technical background appropriate to the WG and experience in Internet architecture and IETF process. At the discretion of the responsible Area Director, a Consultant may be assigned  to a working group.
Working Group Designate
Working Group Chairs may assign individuals as Designates in the IETF Datatracker, so they can take actions usually reserved for group Chairs in Datatracker or other IETF Tools (such as Meetecho).

## Research Group Chair
The chair of an IRTF Research Group has generally the same role as that of an IETF WG Chair, though of course the group they manage is constituted around a charter that is usually quite different from that of a Working Group and does not operate under the same IETF consensus requirements. RG Chairs often have strong interest and experience around a research group’s chartered purpose. RG Chairs are selected by the IRTF Chair and, together, constitute the Internet Research Steering Group (IRSG).

## Nominating Committee Member
The Nominating Committee or, as it is typically known, the NomCom, exists to review open IAB, IESG, IETF Trust, and IETF LLC positions, evaluate individuals wishing to be considered for these positions, and to nominate a candidate for each. Nominating Committee members are randomly selected each year from a pool of individuals who have met eligibility requirements (detailed in RFC 9389), generally recent participation in the IETF),  and have elected to be considered for membership. That is, anyone who meets the requirements can elect to be considered, but the members are determined through a process of random selection. For more detail see, RFC 9389, the Nominating Committee pages on the IETF Datatracker, and the IETF NomCom webpage.

## Area Director
An Area Director (AD) oversees the operations and progress of a set of IETF Working Groups related to a particular technical domain, such as Routing. They are responsible for ensuring WGs produce “coherent, coordinated, architecturally consistent  and timely output as a contribution to the overall results of the IETF.” ADs participate as part of the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) for purposes of the IETF standards process. The ADs for an area are jointly responsible for making sure the WGs in the area are well coordinated, that there is coverage for the technologies needed in the area, and that the challenges most important to the Internet in that area are indeed being worked on. Area Directors are selected via the IETF Nominating Committee processes.

## IAB Member
Internet Architecture Board (IAB) members are expected to act at the “Board” level for the various IAB responsibilities and roles. A principal role of the IAB is to take a broad and long range perspective to offer input into the planning and coordination among different areas of Internet activities, including those of the IETF and Internet Research Task Force (IRTF). IAB members are selected by the IETF NomCom process. For more information, see the IAB website, with specific information about IAB member expectations available via the most recent IETF NomCom webpages.

## IAB Chair
An IAB Chair helps organize the IAB activities (with support from the IETF Secretariat), and serves on a few other bodies, such as the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG). The IAB Chair is not specifically appointed by the IETF NomCom; rather, the chair is selected by the IAB members each year during their first meeting.

## IESG Member
Most Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) Members are Area Directors, and the IESG reviews and approves IETF Standards and approves the publication of other IETF documents. Area Directors are responsible for managing IETF work (e.g. working groups) within their technical area, and for providing cross-area review as part of their position on the IESG. Area Directors generally serve 2-year terms, with most electing to serve at least 2 terms (for a total of 4 years). More information is available in RFC 2026 and the most recent NomCom webpages.

## IETF Chair
The IETF Chair serves and is the designated Area Director for the General Area. They are also responsible for the overall organization of the IESG, and serve on a variety of other bodies (such as the IAB). IETF Chairs are selected via the NomCom process.

## IRTF Chair
The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) Chair oversees and manages the various Internet Research Task Force activities such as the operation of Research Groups, workshops and prizes, and grants. IRTF Chairs generally have a broad background in Internet research and experience working in the IETF community, including in the IRTF. The IRTF Chair is appointed by the Internet Architecture  Board (IAB).

## Directorate Reviewer
Review Directorates gather experienced IETF participants around particular technical areas to provide an advisory group to assist Area Directors with review of specifications produced in the technical area. These reviews are written up and submitted for consideration as part of the IESG evaluation of an I-D. 

Sometimes Review Directorates cover entire areas, such as the Security Area Directorate, and sometimes they cover specific technologies, such as the DNS Review Directorate. Review Directorate membership is determined by the relevant Area Directors. A list of all current Review Directorates is available on the IETF Datatracker.

## IETF Administration LLC Board Member
IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC) Board members set the strategic direction, oversee budgeting, and carry out other fiduciary responsibilities for the IETF LLC, which is the corporate legal home for the IETF, IAB and IRTF, and provides financial support for the operation of the RFC Editor. Three IETF LLC board members are selected by the IETF Nominating Committee. Details about the IETF LLC are available in RFC 8711 and on the IETF LLC webpages.

## Liaison Managers
Liaison Managers manage relationships to other organizations and subgroups, such as Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other Internet governance organizations, on behalf of the IETF. Liaison managers coordinate two-way communications between the IETF and other groups on tips of interest to the IETF community. Liaisons are appointed by the IAB. For more information, see RFC 4052, or the IAB website.
